To-Do App: A Simple Task Management Console Application

This To-Do App is a beginner-friendly, console-based task management system designed to help users efficiently manage their daily tasks. Written in Python, it leverages basic file handling to create a persistent task list stored in a text file. Users can easily view, add, or delete tasks through an intuitive interface.

Features:
  Add Tasks: Users can add tasks to the to-do list, which are immediately saved in a text file for persistence.
  View Tasks: Displays the list of all current tasks with indexing for easy identification. It also handles cases where no tasks are available, providing appropriate feedback to                 the user.
  Delete Tasks: Users can remove specific tasks by selecting their index number. The app ensures input validation to prevent errors.
  Persistent Storage: All tasks are stored in a file (list.txt), ensuring that the to-do list remains intact even after the app is closed.
  Error Handling: Comprehensive exception handling for invalid inputs, missing files, and unforeseen errors to improve user experience and prevent crashes.
  Interactive Menu: A user-friendly text-based menu allows seamless navigation between features.
